### Task Planner API REST with Kotlin and Spring Boot

Micro services that will implement create, read, update y delete (CRUD):

- Users CRUD & signin/Login
- Tasks CRUD

Steps to develop:

1. Create new spring boot web in [Spring Boot Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)
2. Create a controller for each endpoint.
3. Create service interfaces that will be responsible of CRUD operations.
4. Implement the service and inject it to its controller.
5. Try using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or any other web client that could try CRUD.
